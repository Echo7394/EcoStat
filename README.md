Seeduino ESP32C3 Smart Thermostat, but simple, and intuitive. Includes internet access to all functions, but does not spy on you, bloat the mcu with unneccesary code or gather any kind of pointless telemetry whatsover.
Energy saving features are included while not requiring you to sacrifice normal functionality.

Parts required:

**-Seeed Studio Xiao ESP32C3 or other similarly sized ESP32C3 board**

**-Two 5V One Channel Relay Module, I used "HiLetgo 2pcs 5V One Channel Relay Module Relay Switch with OPTO Isolation High Low Level Trigger" from Amazon**
  
**-A DHT22 Sensor, I used a "Gowoops 2pcs DHT22/AM2302 Digital Humidity and Temperature Sensor Module" from Amazon**
  
**-Micro Momentary Button, I used a 4 pin type, you can use anything that fits the mounting hole (6mm or less).**
  
   I also used beads as the buttons themselves for the momentary switches just because the actual button pieces were not long enough, get creative.

**Currently a work in progress. A/C control will be added soon, however since its fall, and cold outside, I havent made it that far yet.**
